<h2><a name="NewInstall_en">(1) Installing the printer driver</a></h2>

<strong>Notes:</strong> <br>
All applications must be closed before installing or upgrading the driver.<br>
This procedure requires administrator privileges (admin account or "Run as Administrator"). <br>
As the information contained in this document applies to multiple print devices, the word "Device" is used as a generic reference to whichever device you are using.<br>
During the installation procedure, a dialog window will appear that will prompt for the generic name (PCL6 Driver for Universal Print) or a version-specific name (RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver VX.X) of the driver. The version-specific name of the driver cannot be upgraded to a new version of the driver because the naming between the driver with the new version-specific name and the old one is different. Therefore, if there are plans to upgrade the driver to a later version in the future, please select the driver with the generic name.

<hr class=semiwidth>
<h1><a name="limitation">Other important points</a></h1>

The settings which are introduced below are depending on the printer or the printer driver you use.

<h2>[General Issue]</h2>

<ul>
<li>To avoid problems in general, make sure that there is plenty of free disk space. 
<li>With some applications (e.g. CorelDRAW, Visio), complicated images may take a long time to print when the Vector/Raster is "Vector". For faster printing, choose "Raster"(Vector/Raster). 
<li>If Vector/Raster is "Raster" then parts of the job might be output as blank unprinted pages. If this occurs, try changing the resolution setting. 

<li>Banner pages cannot be printed using the source tray that is selected to print "Chapter Page". Please use another source tray to print banner pages.
<li>On some applications, the backside of a duplex page is incremented by the device counter. These applications add a blank page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify the number of copies using the driver.
<li>In the environment to which the computer name is set by 16 bytes or more, the host name with banner page print is printed only up to 15 bytes. 
<li>In the case of specific application, only one part will be printed even if the combination of post-processing features and number of copies by from the driver set of multiple.
Post-processing capability refers to the following items.
<ul>
<li>Staple
<li>Punch
<li>Fold
<li>Sort
<li>Perfect Binding 
<li>Layout and Booklet etc.<br>
The example of specific application : Microsoft Office
</ul>
<li>Use of Raster Mode with the Layout settings (= pages per sheet) may be printed roughly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Vector Mode in the PCL driver.
<li>If the registry and configuration files that are generated during driver installation are edited or deleted, the behavior of the driver is not guaranteed. 
<li>This driver does not support a function that TrueType fonts are replaced to printer resident fonts.
<li>When installing a driver, if a different printer's name was selected in the "Install the printer driver" dialog, bidirectional communication cannot be performed normally. Ensure that the correct printer's name is selected when installing the driver.
</ul>
<h2>[OS/Windows Related Issues]</h2>

<ul>

<li>Jobs should not be submitted to the queue while the Windows Print Spooler is not running. 
<li>In some cases, Separator pages might result in anomalies. 
<li>Do not change the "Driver" setting in the Advanced tab. 

<li>The "Web Image Monitor" button in the driver might not work in an IPv6 environment. 
</ul>

<h2>[Driver Setting Related Issues]</h2>

<ul>
<li>Documents may not be stapled at the slant angle, even when you select "Top Left Slant" or "Top Right Slant". In such a case, the document will be stapled parallel to an edge of the paper. 
<li>Printing a large document in booklet, duplex or reverse order printing produce a large temporary file. If you encounter an error when printing a large document in booklet, try again after increasing the free area in system installed drive (e.g. C:). 
<li>Use of a different Paper Source for the cover setting might result in a paper mismatch error. This occurs if the cover is of a different paper size than the rest of the document. This only happens if the cover is not blank and if the source tray for the rest of the document is not "Auto Tray Select". As a workaround, change the print settings so that any one of the above conditions are not met. Note: "cover" = Front Cover, Back Cover or Designate/Chapter 

<li>The use of Reverse Order is not supported with the Duplex, Front Cover, Back Cover, Chapter Pages, Slip Sheet functions.
<li>The number of copies specified using driver's may not work when printing from the following applications:<br>

<ul>
<li>Adobe Reader
<li>Adobe Acrobat
<li>Adobe Illustrator
<li>Adobe InDesign
</ul>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please specify the number of copies using the application's "Copies" setting.
<li>If the Staple setting is "2 at Center" or if the "Reverse Order"setting is On, the driver will add an extra page to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page will be incremented in the printer's counter. There is no way to prevent this.
<li>A paper mismatch error might occur when the measurement unit in the Custom Paper Size dialog is different from the Custom Size setting on the printer operation panel.
</ul>
<h2>[Printing Issues]</h2>

<ul>
<li>Additional Page Count in Duplex Printing. An extra page is added to the end of odd-paged duplex jobs. The added page might be incremented in the printer's counter.
<li>Thin lines printed at high resolution (1200dpix1200dpi) might be difficult to see in the printed output. In such cases, use of a lower resolution is recommended.
<li>Some shaded images may not be printed correctly when Raster Mode is used.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Workaround:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Use Vector Mode in the PCL driver.
<li>Depending on the combination of text and font settings for watermark, text might not be printed.<br>
In such case, a change of font is recommended.
</ul>

<h2>[B/W print with CMYK setting Issue]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black and White documents might be printed in full color (CMYK).
To ensure that the job prints using pure Black (K), please change the color mode to "Black and White" or "Monochrome". 
<li>When selecting "Color" from "Color/ Black and White" setting , black and white document may be printed as a color job, depending on application or data. If you want to print a document in black and white, select "Black and White" in "Color/ Black and White" setting. </ul>



<h2>[Graphics/Images]</h2>

<ul>
<li>Select [Quality] in [Print Priority] setting to clean up noise in printouts. 
<li>When printing particular image data, it may appear noise on the printed document. In this case, select [Quality] in [Print Priority].
</ul>

<h2>[Fonts/Texts]</h2>

<ul>
<li>Documents that contain fonts that are not installed on your computer might not print correctly. 
</ul>

<h2>[Other issues]</h2>
<ul>
<li>To avoid potential problems, "Reverse Order" setting shouldn't be used with Duplex, Front cover, Back cover, Designate/Chapter, or Slip Sheets.
<li>Upgrades with the New Driver button<br>
If a driver is upgraded using the New Driver button, the setting "Automatically Update Printer Information" will be disabled.
Note: If there are multiple logical printers using the upgraded driver, only the "Automatically Update Printer Information" setting of the logical printer used to access the New Driver button will be disabled.  

<li>Bidirectional communication is not available over USB ports. Therefore device accessories cannot be automatically updated via a USB port.
<li>Print jobs that include an underscore in the billing code are canceled on models that do not support underscores in the billing code.
<li>When switching from a model that doesnÅft support the ÅgEncrypt Data for Locked Print, Stored Print, and Stored Print (Shared)Åh function to a model that does, the function will be turned off. Please enable the function after switching the model.
</ul>
